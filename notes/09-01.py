assertions

Collatz Conjecture
100 years old

take a pos int
if even divide by 2
otherwise multiply by 3 and add 1
repeat until 1

5 16 8 4 2 1

cycle length of  5 is 6
cycle length of 10 is 7

assertions are a kind of computational comment

assertions are good for preconditions and postconditions
assertions are good for progammer errors
assertions are NOT good for testing
assertions are NOT good for user errors

Questions:
    When running a Docker image can you map a part of the local file system to a part of the file system in Docker?
    What's the bug in the cycle_length function that we studied today?
    When an assertion fails, what information does it provide?
    What turns off all assertions?
    Why are assertions bad for testing?
    Why are assertions bad for user errors?
